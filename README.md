💼 **Business Analyst | Process Automation Specialist | UiPath & Power Automate Enthusiast**

I’m passionate about bridging the gap between business problems and digital solutions.  
My work focuses on automating repetitive processes, improving data accuracy, and driving efficiency across insurance and financial service workflows.  

I enjoy working at the intersection of Business Analysis and Intelligent Automation, where people, systems, and technology come together to deliver measurable impact.

`Power Automate` · `UiPath` · `SharePoint` · `Excel VBA` · `Power BI` · `MS Dynamics` · `Dataverse`
